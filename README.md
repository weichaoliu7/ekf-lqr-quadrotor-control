# ekf-lqr-quadrotor-control 
This thesis presents the design and experimental implementation of Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) to estimate the states of a quadrotor and a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller to meet the desired control objectives. LQR controller is designed for both the inner and outer loop control by following a double loop control architecture. For the case when position measurements are available, both outer and inner loop controls are established, whereas only inner loop control is designed for the case when position measurements are lost.
